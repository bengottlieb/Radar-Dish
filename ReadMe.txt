Last year, after a suggestion by Dave Dribbin, Tim Burks put together a great community resource to track submissions to Apple's Bug Reporter: Open Radar (http://openradar.appspot.com).

Apple's Bug Reporter is very powerful... for Apple. It is, however, completely opaque to the outside world. Radar (as Apple's reporter is referred to) is not searchable by those outside of Apple. There's no way to tell, before submitting a bug, whether you're repeating the work someone else has done.

The theory behind Open Radar is simple: after submitting a bug to Radar, you can turn around and also submit the same information to Open Radar, which is searchable by all.

Radar Dish aims to simplify and automate this process. You can enter your bug details in, hit one button, and Radar Dish will automatically submit your report first to Radar, and then (along with the Radar number from Apple), to Open Radar.

Enjoy, and please let me know if you have any feedback!
